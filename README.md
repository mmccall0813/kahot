# Kahot

An alternative kahoot client using socket.io and kahoot.js-updated

## Features

- Random nickname bypass
- Automatic curse bypassing
- You dont need to refresh if your kicked

## Notes

- May not work in the future (writing this April 2021) as the kahoot api package I'm using is no longer maintained. If I find another kahoot api package, I will definitely do a rewrite with the new one.
